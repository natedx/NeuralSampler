# NeuralSampler
generative algorithm to create audio sample with ML

You need a proper bank to run the file. As they are to heavy to be on this repository, you can use one of the following methods.

You can create a bank with audio clips on your computer using the proper functions.
You also can download a small snare bank file here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjxMK4Qc8J3fDUIK4yDNenV-OjbjIfss/view?usp=sharing

Be sure to check if the nb_buffs and buffer_size parameters are coherent with the learning part of the algorithm.
